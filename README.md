# Linear Regression Analysis Project


In my linear regression analysis project, I explored the relationships between socio-economic factors and death rates in small cities across America. Using a dataset from G. Scott Thomas's book, which included variables like doctor and hospital availability, income, and population density, I conducted a multiple linear regression analysis. My primary objective was to understand how factors, especially income, impact death rates in these communities.

Employing the R programming environment, I performed multiple linear regression to evaluate the relationships between these variables and provided an example of a visual representation of the results in the form of a graph created with R. Regression_Project.pdf provides a summary of my methodology and the results obtained.
